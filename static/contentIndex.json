Think of it as a ‚Äòscreen‚Äô. Vizzy has two buffer types.\nScreen buffer\nThis is the buffer that everything gets eventually rendered to by default in Vizzy.\nWhile this is not shown to you, every layer is its own buffer (to allow for effects), but all of their outputs eventually become composited to this screen buffer.\n\n\n                  \n                  Did you know? \n                  \n                \n\nWhen you turn 3D mode on, you are seeing all layer buffers at the same time, which is why they don‚Äôt obscure each other.\n\n\nLayer buffer\nThis is a buffer that gets created when you render a layer to a buffer. Every layer will have its own layer buffer. It allows items and effects (even in other layers!) to use the image output of this buffer.\n\n\n                  \n                  Warning! \n                  \n                \n\nRendering a layer to a buffer stops it from being rendered to the screen, which means you have to render it yourself using the Image item, the Transform effect, a custom shader or the Render layer effect.\nYou should never leave buffers not rendered or hanging!\n\n"},"Effects/What-is-an-effect":{"title":"What is an effect?","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"What is an effect?\nKnown issues\n\n\n                  \n                  Alpha bug \n                  \n                \n\nSome effects will cause a confusion between dark colors and transparency, effectively creating unintended blending. You can sometimes remedy this by adding another effect on top - many advanced users choose to add the Crop effect and set all of its values to 0\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Duplicate bug \n                  \n                \n\nSometimes, especially in heavier projects, when adding an effect it might get added twice.\nIMPORTANT: Manually delete one of the effects.

The camera type is automatically selected based on the first item you add to the layer, but you can always change it by clicking the layer.\nOrthographic\nLayers using the orthographic projection use parallel lines to project an outline to a plane. Effectively, this means that objects within the camera‚Äôs clip plane will be the same size\nPerspective\nLayers using the perspective projection will simulate how the human eye or a camera see perspective, i.e. objects further away will appear smaller\n\n\nImage credit1\n\nTransform controls\nEach layer has something called transform controls.\n\nThese controls are none other than the controls for the layer‚Äôs camera.
